# WebSocket "No Close Frame" Error Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing WebSocket errors with the message:
```
Error sending message to session <session_id>: no close frame received or sent
```

This error occurs when:
1. A client disconnects abruptly (e.g., closing browser tab, network interruption)
2. The server tries to send a message to the disconnected client
3. The WebSocket protocol requires a proper close handshake with close frames, but abrupt disconnections don't follow this protocol

## Root Cause

The error was happening in two main scenarios:

1. **Heartbeat Messages**: The background heartbeat system was trying to send heartbeat messages to connections that had been abruptly closed
2. **Response Messages**: The application was trying to send response data to clients that had already disconnected
3. **Race Conditions**: Between connection state checks and actual message sending

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Connection State Management

- Added `_disconnecting` flag to track connections in the process of being cleaned up
- Prevents new messages from being sent to connections being disconnected
- More robust connection state checking with fallbacks

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- **Error Classification**: Added `_is_websocket_disconnected_error()` method to distinguish between expected disconnection errors and real errors
- **Graceful Logging**: Disconnection errors are logged at DEBUG level instead of ERROR level
- **Better Error Messages**: More informative logging for debugging

### 3. Resilient Heartbeat System

- **Active Connection Filtering**: Only send heartbeats to connections that are truly active
- **Better Error Handling**: Handle heartbeat failures gracefully without affecting other connections
- **Snapshot-based Iteration**: Avoid modification-during-iteration issues

### 4. Enhanced Cleanup Process

- **Stale Connection Tolerance**: Increased threshold from 2 to 3 missed heartbeats for better tolerance
- **Double-checking**: Verify connection state before cleanup
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Use snapshots and state flags to prevent cleanup race conditions

## Key Changes Made

### WebSocketConnection Class
```python
class WebSocketConnection:
    # Added disconnection tracking
    _disconnecting: bool = field(default=False, init=False)
    
    def mark_disconnecting(self):
        """Mark connection as disconnecting to prevent new messages."""
        self._disconnecting = True
    
    def is_disconnecting(self) -> bool:
        """Check if connection is in the process of disconnecting."""
        return self._disconnecting
```

### WebSocketConnectionManager Class
```python
def _is_websocket_disconnected_error(self, error: Exception) -> bool:
    """Check if an error indicates a WebSocket disconnection."""
    error_str = str(error).lower()
    disconnection_patterns = [
        "no close frame received or sent",
        "connection closed",
        "websocket connection is closed",
        # ... more patterns
    ]
    return any(pattern in error_str for pattern in disconnection_patterns)

async def send_message(self, session_id: str, message: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    # Check if connection is being disconnected
    if connection.is_disconnecting():
        return False
    
    try:
        # Send message logic
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle disconnection errors gracefully
        if self._is_websocket_disconnected_error(e):
            self.logger.debug(f"Client disconnected during message send: {e}")
        else:
            self.logger.error(f"Error sending message: {e}")
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd backend
python test_websocket_fix.py
```

This script tests:
- Graceful disconnections
- Abrupt disconnections
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Heartbeat resilience

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **No More ERROR Logs**: The "no close frame" errors should no longer appear as ERROR level logs
2. **DEBUG Level Logging**: Disconnection-related errors are logged at DEBUG level
3. **Graceful Cleanup**: Connections are cleaned up properly without affecting other connections
4. **Stable Heartbeats**: Heartbeat system continues working despite individual connection failures

## Monitoring

To monitor the fix effectiveness:

1. **Check Log Levels**: Look for disconnection errors at DEBUG level instead of ERROR
2. **Connection Stats**: Monitor `/ws/stats` endpoint for clean connection counts
3. **System Stability**: Verify that abrupt disconnections don't affect other users

## Prevention

This fix prevents:
- Log spam from expected disconnection scenarios
- Server instability from WebSocket error handling
- Resource leaks from improperly cleaned connections
- Performance degradation from excessive error logging

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. **Connection Metrics**: Track disconnection patterns for monitoring
2. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Adjust heartbeat intervals based on connection stability
3. **Client Reconnection**: Implement automatic reconnection logic on the frontend
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize connection management for high-load scenarios
