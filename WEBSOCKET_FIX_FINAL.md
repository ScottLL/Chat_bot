# üîß WebSocket Connection Race Condition Fix - RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary

The WebSocket connection was failing with the error:
```
‚ùå Message processing error in session XXX: Cannot call "receive" once a disconnect message has been received.
```

This happened because:
1. **Client disconnects** (page refresh, browser close, etc.)
2. **FastAPI receives disconnect signal** internally
3. **Message loop continues** trying to call `websocket.receive_text()`
4. **FastAPI throws error** because WebSocket is already marked as disconnected

## ‚úÖ Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **message receiving loop** in the WebSocket endpoint:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
while True:
    try:
        message_text = await websocket.receive_text()  # ‚ùå This fails after disconnect
        # ... process message
    except Exception as e:
        # ‚ùå Tries to send error message to disconnected client
        await websocket_manager.send_message(session_id, error_msg)
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Improved Message Loop Error Handling**

```python
# FIXED CODE 
while True:
    try:
        message_text = await websocket.receive_text()
        # ... process message
        
    except WebSocketDisconnect as e:
        print(f"üîå WebSocket disconnected during message loop - Session: {session_id}")
        break  # ‚úÖ Clean exit from loop
        
    except Exception as e:
        # ‚úÖ Check if error is connection-related
        error_str = str(e).lower()
        if "disconnect" in error_str or "closed" in error_str or "receive" in error_str:
            print(f"üîå Connection-related error, breaking loop for session {session_id}")
            break
```

### 2. **Protected Message Sending**

All message sending operations now check connection status and handle send failures:

```python
# ‚úÖ Protected message sending
if websocket_manager.is_connection_active(session_id):
    try:
        await websocket_manager.send_message(session_id, message)
    except Exception as send_error:
        print(f"üîå Failed to send message to {session_id}: {send_error}")
        break  # Exit if we can't send
```

### 3. **Streaming Error Handling**

Enhanced the streaming response to handle connection drops during long responses:

```python
# ‚úÖ Protected streaming
async for chunk in connection.agent.ask_question_stream_async(question):
    if not websocket_manager.is_connection_active(session_id):
        break  # Stop streaming if client disconnected
    
    try:
        await websocket_manager.send_message(session_id, chunk_message)
    except Exception as send_error:
        print(f"üîå Failed to send chunk to {session_id}: {send_error}")
        break  # Stop streaming if send fails
```

## ‚úÖ Key Improvements Made

1. **Clean Loop Exit**: Proper handling of `WebSocketDisconnect` exceptions
2. **Connection State Checking**: Verify connection is active before sending messages
3. **Send Error Handling**: Graceful handling of message send failures  
4. **Stream Protection**: Stop streaming immediately when connection is lost
5. **Error Pattern Detection**: Identify connection-related errors and exit cleanly

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

After implementing the fix:

```bash
# BEFORE (Error logs)
‚ùå Message processing error in session XXX: Cannot call "receive" once a disconnect message has been received.

# AFTER (Clean logs)
‚úÖ WebSocket connected - Session: f825442a-cdab-4d40-a50f-cdf8447e1ff9
üì§ Sent initial status message to session f825442a-cdab-4d40-a50f-cdf8447e1ff9
üì® Received message type: question for session f825442a-cdab-4d40-a50f-cdf8447e1ff9
‚úÖ Response generated successfully
```

## ‚úÖ Test Instructions

1. **Open**: http://localhost in browser
2. **Ask a question**: Type any DeFi question and submit
3. **Refresh the page**: While question is processing or after completion
4. **Repeat**: Multiple times to test different scenarios
5. **Check logs**: `docker logs defi-qa-backend -f`

**Expected Result**: No more "Cannot call receive" errors, clean connection handling.

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/main.py`: Enhanced WebSocket error handling in message loop and streaming
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all message sending operations
- Improved connection state checking before sending messages
- Clean exit from message loop on connection-related errors

**Key Functions Updated:**
- `websocket_ask_endpoint()`: Main WebSocket endpoint with improved error handling
- `handle_websocket_question()`: Enhanced streaming error handling  
- All message sending operations: Protected with connection checks

## ‚úÖ Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

The WebSocket connection now handles page refreshes and disconnections gracefully without throwing errors. The application maintains stability and provides a smooth user experience.
