# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem Description

The WebSocket connection was getting stuck in "Connecting..." state after refreshing the page. This was caused by issues in the dependency injection system for the WebSocket endpoint.

## Root Cause

The WebSocket endpoint was using the same dependency injection pattern as HTTP endpoints:
- `get_session()` creates a session using an async context manager
- The context manager automatically cleans up the session when it exits
- For HTTP requests, this works fine because requests are short-lived
- For WebSocket connections, the session needs to persist for the entire connection duration
- The session was being cleaned up immediately after the handshake, leaving the WebSocket with a stale session

## Fix Applied

### Backend Changes (`backend/main.py`)

1. **Created specialized WebSocket dependencies:**
   ```python
   async def get_websocket_session() -> SessionContext:
       """Special dependency for WebSocket connections that creates a persistent session."""
       session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
       session = SessionContext(session_id=session_id)
       
       # Add to session manager without using context manager
       async with session_manager._lock:
           session_manager._sessions[session_id] = session
       
       return session

   async def get_websocket_agent(session: SessionContext = Depends(get_websocket_session)) -> AsyncDeFiQAAgent:
       """Dependency for creating WebSocket-scoped async agents."""
       agent = await get_async_agent_factory().create_agent(session)
       RequestContextManager.set_session(session)
       RequestContextManager.set_agent(agent)
       return agent
   ```

2. **Updated WebSocket endpoint to use new dependencies:**
   ```python
   @app.websocket("/ws/ask")
   async def websocket_ask_endpoint(
       websocket: WebSocket,
       session: SessionContext = Depends(get_websocket_session),  # Changed from get_session
       agent: AsyncDeFiQAAgent = Depends(get_websocket_agent)     # Changed from get_async_agent
   ):
   ```

3. **Added manual session cleanup in the finally block:**
   ```python
   finally:
       # Clean up connection
       await websocket_manager.disconnect(websocket)
       
       # Clean up the session manually since we didn't use context manager
       async with session_manager._lock:
           if session_id in session_manager._sessions:
               del session_manager._sessions[session_id]
   ```

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

1. **Enhanced WebSocket connection logging:**
   - Added detailed console logs for connection attempts
   - Improved error messages with connection codes and reasons
   - Added attempt counter for reconnection attempts

2. **Added manual reconnect functionality:**
   ```typescript
   const manualReconnect = () => {
     console.log('ðŸ”„ Manual reconnection requested');
     disconnectWebSocket();
     reconnectAttempts.current = 0;
     setTimeout(() => {
       connectWebSocket();
     }, 1000);
   };
   ```

3. **Added Reconnect button in the UI:**
   - Shows when connection status is 'error' or 'disconnected'
   - Allows users to manually retry connection
   - Resets reconnection attempt counter

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Restart the services
```bash
# Stop existing services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Test the WebSocket connection
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost`
2. Check the browser console for connection logs:
   ```
   ðŸ”— Attempting WebSocket connection to: ws://localhost/ws/ask
   âœ… WebSocket connected successfully
   ðŸ“¨ WebSocket message received: status
   ```

### 3. Test reconnection after refresh
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Watch the console - it should connect immediately without getting stuck
3. Ask a question to verify the connection is working

### 4. Test manual reconnection
1. If the connection fails, you should see a "Reconnect" button next to the status
2. Click the button to manually retry the connection
3. Check console logs for reconnection attempts

### 5. Test automatic reconnection
1. Stop the backend container: `docker stop defi-qa-backend`
2. The frontend should show "Connection Error" and attempt to reconnect
3. Restart the backend: `docker start defi-qa-backend`
4. The connection should be re-established automatically

## Expected Behavior

- âœ… WebSocket connects immediately on page load
- âœ… WebSocket reconnects automatically after page refresh
- âœ… Manual reconnect button appears when connection fails
- âœ… Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- âœ… Proper session management for WebSocket connections
- âœ… Detailed console logging for debugging

## Debug Information

If issues persist, check the following:

### Frontend Console Logs
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and look for:
ðŸ”— Attempting WebSocket connection to: ws://localhost/ws/ask
âœ… WebSocket connected successfully
ðŸ“¨ WebSocket message received: status
```

### Backend Logs
```bash
# Check Docker logs
docker logs defi-qa-backend

# Look for:
âœ… WebSocket connected for session <session_id>
âœ… Session management system initialized
âœ… Async Agent Factory initialized
```

### Connection Status Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ Green dot: Connected
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow dot: Connecting...
- ðŸ”´ Red dot: Connection Error
- âšª Gray dot: Disconnected

If the issue persists, the problem may be related to:
1. Network configuration
2. Docker networking
3. NGINX proxy settings
4. Backend service startup issues
